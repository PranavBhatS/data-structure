#How does Javascript run?
     JS in a single threaded language is that can be non blocking.

     //memory heap

     //call stack

     // web api call

     // callback queue

     // job queue / microqueue => this has higher priority than callback queue

     //  event loop
     check is call stack is empty?

     #Memory leaks
